# Simon-The-Game

Simon Says is a memory game where players must replicate a sequence of illuminated squares. The game consists of a grid with four colored squares, each emitting a unique tone when activated.

Rules:

- The game starts with a single square lighting up at random.
- The player must then replicate the sequence by clicking on the squares in the same order.
- Successfully repeating the sequence advances the player to the next round with an expanded sequence.
- An incorrect entry ends the game, and the player's score reflects the number of successful rounds completed.
